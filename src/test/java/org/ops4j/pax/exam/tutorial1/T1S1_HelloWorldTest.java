 * This is the simpliest test possible.

 * It uses all default options (which means felix as platform, no additional bundles but exam itself and your test)
 *
 * To get Pax Exam running with minimal code, this class shows whats neeeded.
 * Additionally you just need the required jars/dependencies from pax exam in your classpath.
 * Nothing more.
