This is a tiny, hands-on tutorial to see if pax exam is useful for you,
and to learn the very basics.

You'll find hands-on text on the wiki at http://wiki.ops4j.org//x/aYKr .

You can adjust the log4j.properties in src/test/resources to get more or less insight into the innner workings of exam.

To understand whats going on, we recommend reading the reference documentation:

All "Test Cases" in this package are very small and building on each other in terms of "new things to learn".
